# SootheSphere

SootheSphere is a web app designed to offer a calming space where you can find ease during anxious or difficult moments, or simply when you want to feel better and express your thoughts freely, all on your own.

In SootheSphere, we use sound to help people relax. There are soothing soundtracks, guided meditations, and even tracks to cool off when you’re feeling angry. But the real highlight is the Journal Space—a personal space where you can express your thoughts and feelings, and based on your emotions (or the emoji you choose), the app plays background music tailored to your mood.

There’s also a mood tracker built in. It helps you see patterns in how you’ve been feeling over time. If the app notices you’re having a lot of tough days, it can gently remind you to think about seeking extra support from a professional.

Our aim with SootheSphere is to create a space where you can express yourself freely, feel more at ease, and understand your emotions better. To bring this vision to life, we built SootheSphere using the MERN stack: React for the frontend, MongoDB for storing data, Express for the backend, and Node.js to bring it all together.
